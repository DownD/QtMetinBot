# MetinBot
An old bot for Metin2 orivate servers.<br>
<b>I stopped the development, currently is not working. The Bot needs a big change in the GUI and in some classes in order to become more simple to make changes.</b><br>
I created this bot as way to learn more about reverse engenering alongside OOP code organization and GUI devolpment, as this game as a leaked (old) source client available in the internet making it not too hard to start RE (Reverse Enggener) but still offering some challanges as some private servers implement different game systems and protection measures, wich some times become fun to bypass.
